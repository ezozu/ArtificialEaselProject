# ArtificialEaselProject

## Description

A generative NFT art platform leveraging a custom-trained transformer model with attention-based style transfer, integrated with a decentralized storage solution using IPFS and Ethereum smart contracts for provenance and ownership verification.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificialEaselProject:
- "Utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create realistic brushstroke simulations",
- "Employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image segmentation and object detection",
- "Provides a customizable palette management system with color theorybased suggestions",
- "Supports realtime collaboration through WebSockets and differential synchronization",
- "Includes a physicsbased engine for simulating canvas texture and material interactions",
- "Offers a plugin architecture for integrating thirdparty AI models and algorithms",
- "Features a machine learningbased recommendation system for art supply and technique suggestions"
- Let me know if you need any adjustments!
